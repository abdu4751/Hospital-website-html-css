# 🏥 Hospital Website (HTML + CSS)

This is a simple and clean landing page for a hospital website, built using **HTML and CSS** only.  
It includes basic sections like:

- Hero banner / homepage layout  
- About Us  
- Services  
- Contact section  
- Footer

> 🚫 No JavaScript has been used in this version.  
> 📱 Currently not fully responsive — mobile responsiveness will be added in upcoming iterations.


## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring semantic HTML  
- Styling with Flexbox & custom CSS  
- Creating reusable layouts (header/footer)  
- Project organization using clean folders and naming

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for interactivity (e.g. show/hide password, navbar toggle)  
- Make the layout responsive with media queries or Bootstrap  
- Deploy live using GitHub Pages  
- Add a form and integrate basic validation
